# Weather.ly

Passion project weather app by [Anders Blom](http://andersblom.dk). This is made as a prototype ahead of a React Native app being built down the road.

## Try this out locally
1. Clone this repo to your computer. 
    `git clone https://github.com/andersblom/weather.ly.git`
2. Run the app with `npm run start` or ´yarn start´, and we have lift off! 
3. Go to ´localhost:3000´ and browse away!

### Storage
This app utilizes `localStorage()`, and thus does not need a database setup, nor is there any user signup / sign in. This is subject to change at the release of the native version.
